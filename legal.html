        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: 11/11/2025</p>

        <div class="tos-content">
            <p>
                These Terms of Service govern your access to and use of the Thinkmay CloudPC services, websites, <br>and related software (collectively, the “Service”) provided by Thinkmay Company Limited<br>(“Thinkmay”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.</p>

            <h2>1. Who we are</h2>

            <p>Registered address: 456 Xo Viet Nghe Tinh Street, Ward 25, Binh Thanh District, Ho Chi Minh City,<br> Vietnam</p>
            <p>Primary business: Software as a Service (SaaS) - Cloud PC</p>

            <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
            <p>The Service is available to individuals and businesses.</p>
            <p>Minors may use the Service only with the consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian who accepts these Terms on their behalf. The Service is not directed to children under 13.</p>

            <h2>3. Accounts & Authentication</h2>
            <p>You may create an account to use the Service. Authentication is supported via Google OAuth2 using your Google email address.</p>

            <p>You must promptly notify us of any unauthorized use of your account.</p>

            <h2>4. Uploads, Storage & Access</h2>
            <p>The Service allows you to upload files. Uploaded files are private to your account and are not shared with other users through the Service by default.</p>
            <p>You retain all ownership rights in your files and data (“User Content”). You grant Thinkmay a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive license to host, run, and process User Content solely to operate and provide the Service to you.</p>
            <p>You are solely responsible for your User Content and for ensuring it complies with these Terms and applicable laws.</p>

            <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
            <p>You agree not to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use the Service in any manner that violates applicable law or infringes third-party rights.</li>
              <li>Upload malicious code, spam, or content that is unlawful, harmful, or abusive.</li>
              <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or other accounts.</li>
              <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to derive source code except to the extent permitted by law.</li>
              <li>Use our brand, trademarks, or interface to white-label or commercially repackage the Service.<br> (See Section 9.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We may suspend or terminate your account for any violation of these Terms.</p>
            
            <h2>6. Plans, Billing & Payments</h2>
            <p>Thinkmay offers paid plans and subscriptions. By starting a paid plan, you authorize Thinkmay (or our payment providers) to charge you the applicable fees.</p>
            <h3>6.1 Payments methods</h3>
            <p>We support:</p>
            <strong>One-time (end-of-cycle) billing:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>PayOS (VietQR bank transfer)</li>
              <li>Stripe (international credit/debit cards)</li>
              <li>Thesieure (mobile top-up cards)</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Auto-renewing subscriptions:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Stripe (international cards)</li>
              <li>MoMo (e-wallet)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>6.2 Auto-renewal</h3>
            <p>Subscriptions auto-renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel before the renewal date. You can cancel in your account settings.</p>
            <h3>6.3 Price changes</h3>
            <p>We may change prices with reasonable prior notice. Changes take effect in the next billing cycle.</p>

            <h2>7. Service Availability & Modifications</h2>
            <p>We strive to keep the Service available and performant, but downtime or interruptions may occur (e.g., maintenance, network issues, data-center incidents).</p>
            <p>Features may evolve over time. We may modify or discontinue features without liability.</p>

            <h2>8. Security & Data Loss</h2>
            <p>We implement safeguards to protect your data. However, you are responsible for maintaining appropriate backups of your content.</p>
            <p>We are not responsible for data loss caused by your actions or your environment, including but not limited to malware or misconfiguration on your devices or networks.</p>

            <h3>9. Brand & Marketing Use</h3>
            <p>You may reference Thinkmay and use our name/logo for legitimate advertising or affiliate purposes relating to the Service.</p>
            <p>You may not (a) misrepresent any affiliation or endorsement, (b) white-label, resell, or commercially repackage the Service, or (c) use our brand in a confusing or unlawful way.</p>
            <p>All goodwill from permitted use accrues to Thinkmay.</p>

            <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>The Service, including software, interfaces, and documentation, is owned by Thinkmay or its licensors and is protected by intellectual-property laws.</p>
            <p>Except as expressly allowed, no rights are granted to you beyond a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Service during your active plan/subscription.</p>

            <h2>11. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The Service integrates with third-party services for payments and analytics (e.g., PayOS, Stripe, MoMo, Thesieure, RybbiRybbit). Your use of those services may be subject to their own terms and policies. Thinkmay is not responsible for third-party services and does not share our database with third parties for their independent purposes.</p>

            <h2>12. Termination</h2>
            <p>You may stop using the Service at any time and may cancel auto-renewal as described in Section 6.2.</p>
            <p>We may suspend or terminate your access immediately if you breach these Terms, cause security or legal risk, or if required by law.</p>
            <p>Upon termination or expiration, your right to access the Service ends. Sections that by nature should survive (e.g., 6.3, 8–13) will survive.</p>

            <h2>13. Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p><strong>Disclaimers. </strong>The Service is provided “as is” and “as available.” To the fullest extent permitted by law, Thinkmay disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>
            <p><strong>Limitation. </strong>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Thinkmay and its affiliates will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages; loss of profits or revenues; or loss of data, even if we have been advised of the possibility. Our aggregate liability for all claims relating to the Service shall not exceed the amounts you paid to Thinkmay in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.</p>
            <p><strong>User-side risks. </strong>We are not liable for losses resulting from malware, compromised devices, or misconfigurations on your side.</p>
            <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow certain disclaimers or limitations; in those cases, the above applies to the maximum extent permitted.</p>

            <h2>14. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Vietnam without regard to conflict-of-laws rules. You consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.</p>
            <p>If you are a U.S. resident, you may have non-waivable consumer rights under U.S. law in addition to the foregoing. Nothing in these Terms limits such mandatory rights.</p>

            <h2>15. Changes to these Terms</h2>
            <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If changes are material, we will provide reasonable notice (e.g., via the website or in-product notice). Your continued use of the Service after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

            <h2>16. Contact</h2>
